# Fraud Detection using Autoencoders in Keras

This project implements a fraud detection system using autoencoders, a type of neural network, implemented in Keras. The model is designed to identify anomalies in financial transactions that may indicate fraudulent activity.
Project Overview

Fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in the financial sector. This project uses autoencoders, a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, to learn the patterns of normal transactions and identify outliers that may represent fraudulent activities.
